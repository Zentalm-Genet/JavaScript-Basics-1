/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = " It involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and managing the requirements that will shape the scope and quality of your software project."

const design = "The design phase is a stage where software developers define the technical details of the product. Depending on the project, these details can include screen designs, databases, sketches, system interfaces, and prototypes. Clients use these details to make final product design choices."

const Implementation = "The implementation stage (also known as the coding stage), involves translating the design documents into actual software. As software engineers reference the requirements spec and the design documents written in the previous stages, they write the code to meet those specifications"

const testingIntegration = "testing and integration is to detect and fix errors, bugs, and defects as early as possible in the SDLC, and to ensure that the software is always in a working and deployable state."

const Maintain = "Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched."
